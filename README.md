# tranformer-learning
show how I learn transformer from scratch

here is my planning
1. read some video from bilibili to have a intuition of transformer
2. ask gpt or something else to create an outline
3. assmble all external files(docs/codes) and link each other
4. summary by myself, maybe make a video or share
